Welcome to my personal website.This is a central hub where I share my skills, personal and professional experiences as well as projects.
I am Emmanuella Appiah Akwaboah. You can call me Ella and I would gladly respond. 
I am a Pharmacist with over a decade of experience in pharmaceutical care, research and development, community and hospital pharmacy with little bit of academia thrown in the mix.
Personally, I wear many hearts. I am a wife, a mum, a daughter, a sister and a friend.
I share from my experiences and I hope we learn from one another going forward.
